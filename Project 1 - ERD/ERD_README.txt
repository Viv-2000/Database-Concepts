# Database Concepts Assignment README

## Overview
This document serves as a comprehensive guide to the Database Concepts assignment. The assignment is designed to test knowledge and skills in designing databases using Entity-Relationship (ER) models and implementing relational database schemas. It is divided into two parts: ER Modelling and Relational Database Modelling.

## Part A: Entity-Relationship Modelling
### Task 1: Designing an ER Model
**Objective:** Develop an ER model to represent the organizational structure and operations of Exercise Central, a fitness company. This involves modeling entities like Staff, Clients, and Exercise Plans.

**Approach:**
- Identified and defined strong and weak entities based on the business rules provided.
- Established relationships with appropriate cardinality between entities such as Staff, Exercise Plans, and Clients.
- Used UML notation and Lucidchart for diagramming the model.

### Task 2: Client Adjustments and Revisions
**Objective:** Modify the initial ER model based on new client requirements for the Quick Service vehicle repair center.
- Added relationships to track which mechanics installed parts or resolved issues.
- Included attributes to record part installation fees.

### Task 3: Mapping ER to Relational Schema
**Objective:** Convert the ER diagram into a relational database schema, detailing each step.
- Mapped strong and weak entities into relational tables.
- Identified primary and foreign keys.
- Addressed relationships, especially many-to-many through join tables.

## Part B: Relational Database Model
### Task 4: Analyzing and Modifying the Relational Database
**Objective:** Answer specific questions about the relational database schema to identify and rectify issues.
- Checked for missing foreign key constraints.
- Adjusted the schema to accommodate organizational changes like new sub-departments.
- Wrote SQL statements to reflect changes in the database instance.
