# Project 2 - SQL Programming and Normalisation README

## Overview
This README document provides an overview and solutions for Project 2, focusing on SQL Programming and Normalisation. This project aims to enhance understanding of relational database design, SQL querying, and normalisation processes, which are critical for efficient database management.

## Task Details and Solutions

### Part A: Relational Database Design
**Objective:** Address relational database design for a consultancy company with specific business rules.

**Tasks Include:**
1. **Functional Dependencies and Normalisation**
   - Identified and defined functional dependencies for each provided relation.
   - Analyzed the normal forms of each relation and decomposed them into 3NF where necessary.

2. **Final Relational Database Schema**
   - Developed a comprehensive final schema after merging and decomposing relations based on normalization principles.
   - Ensured that all relations were in 3NF to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.

### Part B: SQL
**Objective:** Write efficient SQL queries for various data retrieval needs based on a fictional library database schema.

**Tasks Include:**
1. **Query Formulation**
   - Constructed SQL queries to address different real-world scenarios such as finding overdue books, computing total books by subject, and identifying unique borrower details.
   - Emphasized the importance of logical query construction to ensure correctness regardless of database state changes.

2. **Complex Query Solutions**
   - Addressed complex SQL challenges, including aggregation, joining multiple tables, and handling subqueries.
   - Demonstrated the use of SQL functions to manage date types and string manipulations.

### Part C: Research Questions
**Objective:** Provide a detailed report discussing the design and functionality of the Library database.
- Analyzed the implications of the Dewey Decimal Classification system on database integrity.
- Suggested improvements for linking persons and authors in the database to enhance relational design.

## Conclusion
This project encapsulates the practical application of database design theories, emphasizing the critical role of normalization in database management and the versatility of SQL for effective data handling.


## Documentation and Formatting
- Presented findings in a structured format suitable for both technical and non-technical audiences.
- Ensured clarity and thoroughness in explaining the methodology and reasoning behind each solution.
